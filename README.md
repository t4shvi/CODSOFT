# Personal Portfolio (HTML + CSS)

This is a small, editable portfolio starter created with plain HTML and CSS. Replace the placeholder text, images, and `resume/resume.pdf` with your own content.

Files created:
- `index.html` — main page with header, about, skills, projects, resume download, contact, footer
- `css/styles.css` — styles for layout and components
- `images/` — placeholder SVG images for profile and projects
- `resume/resume.pdf` — tiny placeholder PDF; replace with your real resume

How to view locally:
1. Open `index.html` in a browser, or
2. Serve the folder with a simple server (Python example shown):

```powershell
# from repository root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Replace content and images, then enjoy your portfolio.
